	<h2>Homemade Mac and Cheese</h2>
	<p>Mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping with cheese sauce made from scratch.</p>

	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<h4>Macaroni and Cheese</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
		<li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons all-purpose floor</li>
		<li>2 1/2 cups milk, or more as needed</li>
		<li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
		<li>1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
		<li>salt and ground black pepper (Optional)</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Bread Crumb Topping</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
		<li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
		<li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Directions</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li><br>
		<li>Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
			Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, <br> until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; 
			it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li><br>
		<li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet <br> over low heat. Whisk in flour and
			 stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li><br>
		<li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and 
		finely grated Parmesan cheeses; <br> season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and 
		sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup <br> more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir 
		until well combined.</li><br>
		<li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir 
			until well coated <br> and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li><br>
		<li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li><br>
	</ol>
